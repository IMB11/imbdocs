# Hot Reloading Skins

SkinShuffle supports hot reloading of skins. This means that you can make changes to your skin files and see the changes in-game without having to rejoin a server or restart the game.

This feature only works when you are in a singleplayer world, or on a server that has the mod installed or a suitable [bridge plugin installed.](https://modrinth.com/plugin/skinshuffle-bridge)
