# YACL Helpers

MRU provides a set of utility methods that allow rapid creation of manual YACL configuration screens without the need to use annotations or autogen.

Simply create an instance of the `ConfigHelper` class within your configuration class, and use the various utility methods.

You should refer to the javadoc of the methods for more information - generally it's self explanatory.
